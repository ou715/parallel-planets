### About
The goal of this program is to implement a (simple) ray tracer and parallelise it using OpenMPI.

### Goals
- [ ] Parallel (OpenMPI) ray tracing program
- [ ] Objects moving according to a law of motion (ODE Solver)
- [ ] Object/camera movement and video generation
- [ ] Split work across a cluster (motion vs visualisation)


### Progress Tracker
| Name                          | Status        | Comment                                     |
|-------------------------------|---------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Static image ray traced       | done          | only simple shapes, like spheres and planes |
| OpenMPI integration           | in progress   | basic division of work, one communicator    | 
| Reflective surfaces           | to be started | specular reflections                        |
| Transparent objects           | to be started | can include colour changes                  |
| Central force movement        | to be started | probably solved using Runge-Kutta
| Dynamic image generation      | in progress   | to simulate camera and/or object movement   |
| Stitch images into a video    | to be started | probably using ffmpeg                       |
| OpenMPI cluster communication | to be started | surely networking is simple                 |
